## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Position properties
- CSS clip path
- CSS z-index property

### What I learned

I have got to know about CSS "Clip path" Property, it was quite useful here:

```
.gb-box::before {
    clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 100%, 100% 0);
}
```

Also I have used depth knowledge of "Position: relative and Position: absolute "

other Properties that was big help for me "z-index and pseudo-elements".

### Continued development

I will continue to learn these properties and explore them in depth:

- clip-path
- z-index
- position: relative
- position: absolute
- pseduo-elements

### Useful resources

- [Clip Path](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - This helped me with clip-path property. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
